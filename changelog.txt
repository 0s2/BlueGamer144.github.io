About: A p5.js tropical cyclone simulation game

v0.2.0: Many changes:

+ Much tweaking on steering (influencing the shear of course) and some on moisture
+ Improved storm algorithm
+ Some other changes

v0.1.1: Some changes:
+ Tweaked spawn rates and location, and added a function which allows non-tropical lows to form deeper down, and lows can form off-season now
+ Minimally tweaked climate, SSTs and SST-Anomalies
+ Enhanced the algorithm with constrains

v0.1.0: Replaced Normal with Semi-Realisic, aiming at less excessive dependence on sea surface temperatures from the Storm algorithm, which
is modified here, including some random EWRCs. Also took many sea suface temperature anomalies and steering settings from Magicdrizzles fork.
